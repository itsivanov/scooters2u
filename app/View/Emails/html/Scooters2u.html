            <p>
              I, for myself and/or on behalf of my child or legal ward, have been fully warned and advised by Scooter2U, (herein collectively referred to as “S2U”), that we should purchase and/or wear a properly fitted and secured DOT or SNELL certified helmet while riding or being around scooter’s (wether on the premises of S2U or off the premises) in order to reduce the severity of some of our head injuries and to possibly prevent my/our death from happening as the result of a fall(s) or any other occurrence associated with this activity. We realize that we are subject to injury from this activity and that no form of preplanning can remove all of the danger to which we are exposing ourselves. Against the advice of S2U, the guide/instructor, numerous court cases and S2U’s insurance company, we are refusing this critical safety precaution.
